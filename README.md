ðŸ•’ Digital Clock Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a real-time digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses JavaScript's Date object to fetch the current time and updates dynamically every second to display the hours, minutes, and seconds.

The DOM manipulation techniques used in JavaScript provide a hands-on understanding of how to update content in real-time, while CSS styling enhances the clock's visual appearance for a sleek and modern interface.

This project is perfect for beginners looking to strengthen their grasp of:

JavaScript's Date and Time functions

Real-time DOM updates

Styling and layout with CSS
